Please note that ffmpeg x265 were using whole cpu at ~1100% utilization on 12 threads system.

To match with x265 in terms of cpu utilization and speed, for AV1 and VP9 [Av1an](https://github.com/master-of-zen/Av1an) was used.

For single AV1 encoder instances, multiple the time values by ~4-6.

Original footage taken from [xiph](https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/). It called Dota 2

For encoding fps was reduced from 60 to 30, and video for encoding was composed from 6 scenes of this footage.
