Please note that ffmpeg x265 were using whole cpu at ~1100% utilization on 12 threads system.

To match with x265 in terms of cpu utilization and speed,[Av1an](https://github.com/master-of-zen/Av1an) was used.

For single encoder instances, multiple the time values by 6.
AAlso, sorry that there are missing values for CPU 0, as it was taking a considerable amount of time for a single test, over an hour, and that is with scene splits.
